# APT1
### Suspect
- China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) Unit 61398
### Tools and techniques
- GETMAIL and MAPIGET designed to steal email
- In 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) of the Remote Desktop sessions APT1 conducted under our observation, the APT1
operator’s keyboard layout setting was “Chinese (Simplified) — US Keyboard”. Microsoft’s Remote Desktop client
configures this setting automatically based on the selected language on the client system. Therefore, the APT1
attackers likely have their Microsoft® operating system configured to display Simplified Chinese fonts.
- 817 of the 832 (98%) IP addresses logging into APT1 controlled systems using Remote Desktop resolved back to
China.
- APT1 intruders used the “HUC Packet Transmit Tool” or HTRAN
to communicate between 614 distinct routable IP addresses and their victims’ systems using their attack
infrastructure. Of the 614 distinct IP addresses used for HTRAN communications:
  − 614 of 614 (100%) were registered in China. <br>
  − 613 (99.8%) were registered to one of four Shanghai net blocks.
### Statistics
- Average maintained access to victim networks of 356 days.
- Longest time of persistence was 4 years and 10 months.
- First month of 2011, APT1 successfully compromised at least 17 victims in 10 different industries.
- Of the 141 APT1 victims, 87% of them are headquartered in countries where English is the native language.
